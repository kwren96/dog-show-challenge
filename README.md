### Deliverables

- Once the form is submitted, the table should reflect the updated dog information. There are many ways to do this. You could search for the table fields you need to edit and update each of them in turn, but we suggest making a new get request for all dogs and rerendering all of them in the table. Make sure this GET happens after the PATCH so you can get the most up-to-date dog information.
